== Base App Mongoid ==

This Rails application is just a base application. It's good to start a new
project with this stack :

 * Mongoid
 * Devise
 * Decent Exposure
 * Simple_form
 * Omniauth
 * Haml
 * Sass

There are just a login with omniauth system from devise. And see how you can
fetch the twitter list of user.

A default CSS is define using the twitter bootstrap project

I add jquery and rails.js javascript

=== Test ===

There are some test inside this project with acceptance too. This test use

 * Rspec
 * Steack
 * Mongoid-rspec
 * FactoryGirl

You can start with it and raise it.
